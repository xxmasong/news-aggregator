            "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail Across the span of nearly a week, the saga of a lost submersible that had gone into the depths of the ocean to see the Titanic wreckage rippled across the global conversation — culminating in news that the craft had imploded and its five occupants were dead. But a far bigger disaster days earlier, the wrecking of a ship off Greece filled with migrants that killed at least 80 people and left a horrifying 500 missing , did not become a moment-by-moment worldwide focus in anywhere near the same way. One grabbed unrelenting, moment-to-moment attention. One was watched and discussed as another sad, but routine, news story. READ MORE: What's next in the search for the imploded submersible? ﻿ A small OceanGate submersible (OceanGate) What makes these two events at sea different in how they were received? Viewed next to each other, what do they say about human reactions to tragic news? And why did the saga of the submersible grab so much attention? There was an unknown outcome and (we thought) a ticking clock By the time the world learned about the Greek shipwreck , the event had already taken place and, to some extent, the outcome was already known. All that was left was the aftermath. Conversely, the Titan (the world thought) was an event in the process of happening — something that unfolded in real time with a deadline attached. As with any narrative, a ticking clock increases tension and attention. The fact that no one could communicate with the submersible — or learn anything about what the people inside were experiencing — only added to the potential for close attention. And the possibility of a happy ending — at least for a while — also helped sustain attention, said Jennifer Talarico, a psychology professor at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania who studies how people form personal memories of public events.

(Hellenic Coastguard via AP) A renowned historical tragedy was back in the news Before anything even went awry, the Titan was already venturing into a realm of existing high interest — the wreck of the Titanic, itself the archetype of modern disasters long before James Cameron's popular 1997 film. So there was an interest already baked in that had nothing to do with the submersible itself. Cameron's reaction to the Titan disaster only intensified that connection. He told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Friday that he \"felt in my bones\" that the Titan submersible had been lost soon after he heard it had lost contact with the surface during its descent to the wreckage of the ocean liner at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. He said focus in the media over the next few days about the submersible having 96 hours of oxygen supply — and that banging noises had been heard — was a \"prolonged and nightmarish charade\".

(Mario Anzuoni/Reuters) Class and race played a role Many reactions and memes this week centred around the notion — fair or not — that one event involved rich people using the ocean as a playground, while the other was a sadly frequent recurrence of misfortune befalling people who lack status, resources or even a voice in the modern marketplace of ideas. Apryl Alexander, a public health professor at University of North Carolina-Charlotte who has studied trauma and survivors, said the migrants on the ship in Greece didn't seem to engender the same interest from the public as did the wealthy individuals who paid $US250,000 ($374,000) apiece to explore the Titanic. That reminded Alexander of the differences in news coverage of crime in the United States. Crimes get more attention when the victim is white and wealthy compared to a person of colour in poverty, Alexander said. READ MORE: Teen was 'terrified' in lead up to doomed Titanic sub trip ﻿ Apryl Alexander, a public health professor at University of North Carolina-Charlotte who has studied trauma and survivors, said the migrants on the ship in Greece didn't seem to engender the same interest. (AP) A small group of people had the media's ear Tim Recuber, an assistant professor of sociology at Smith College who studies mass media, digital culture and emotions, said people tend to be drawn to stories that allow them to empathise with the suffering of others — and that it's easier to empathise when there are smaller numbers of people involved. \"I think some people are calling out this time around the sort of inequalities that are baked into it around class,\" Recuber said. \"We are able to learn who the people on the sub are because of who they are. They're wealthy and they have access to the press. \"Divisions of race and national identity matter in terms of who gets empathised with.\" Survivors of a shipwreck are seen inside a warehouse where they're taking shelter at the port in Kalamata, Greece. (AP) The public lives vicariously through the risks others take Individuals who choose their risks have grabbed headlines almost since there have been headlines. So the public was likely enthralled about others cheating death by doing something dangerous, said Daryl Van Tongeren, a psychology professor at Hope College in Michigan who has studied the meaning around big events and their effect on people. In other words, he said, readers and viewers can feel alive by living vicariously through others who are taking risks. \"There's this fascination with people who engage in these high-risk experiences,\" Van Tongeren said. \"Even though we know that death is the only certainty in life, we invest in these activities where we get close to death but overcome it. We want to demonstrate our mastery over death,\" he said. The five aboard were pilot Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate; French explorer and Titanic expert Paul-Henry Nargeolet﻿; British adventurer and billionaire Hamish Harding; and Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman. (9News) Disaster fatigue is a factor, too The pandemic. Mass shootings. Economic problems. War. Climate change. It can be hard for another piece of bad news to punch through. \"People are starting to tune out,\" Alexander said. In the end, she said, she'd like to see the same level of societal interest in human tragedies regardless of race, religion, demographics, or other factors. \"For all of us, we hope that if any of our loved ones go missing that the media and the public would pay the same attention to all stories,\" she said.

Article content On Saturday, roughly 125 people of all ages participated in the ninth annual local event held at Central Park Athletics Centre to help celebrate the International Day of Yoga. Local interest in yoga continues to slowly gather newcomers across Windsor and Essex County as an enjoyable alternative to help achieve a healthy body and mind, said organizers who estimate roughly 5,000 people across Windsor and Essex County currently practice yoga. “Yoga is very good for health, happiness, unity, peace, harmony — all of those things,” said Samir Thaker, co-organizer of Saturday’s event. “This can help you by making yoga a normal part of your life. It is not hard. it is open to people from all walks of life — for the younger people to the most senior. Everybody can practice yoga. Article content “This is the ninth year we have been doing this and inviting people. We are very happy so many people are joining us today.” The event in part was also to help those in attendance learn a few new moves, Thanker said. “There are many techniques in yoga,” Thaker said. “You don’t have to do everything, just start small. Whatever you can do based on your ability and your body allows you to do. There are many easy things one can start doing and then they will see the benefits of practicing yoga for themselves. “We invite people of all ages, not just those who are younger or a particular gender. It’s open to everyone and it’s easy. In today’s world there is a lot of stress, anxiety and mental health issues. Yoga can help you overcome all of it.” Article content Share this article in your social network Share this Story:",

            "content": "Russian troops deployed to protect the capital withdrew Sunday after mercenary forces beat a retreat. But the short-lived revolt could have long-term consequences for President Vladimir Putin’s two-decade hold on power and his war in Ukraine. Putin’s image as a tough leader had already been badly bruised by the Ukraine war , which has dragged on for 16 months and claimed huge numbers of Russian troops. Saturday’s march toward Moscow by forces under the command of his onetime protege, Yevgeny Prigozhin , exposed further weaknesses, many analysts said. It also meant some of the best forces fighting for Russia in Ukraine were pulled from that battlefield: Prigozhin’s own Wagner troops and Chechen ones sent to stop them. After calling for an armed rebellion aimed at ousting Russia’s defense minister, Prigozhin and his fighters appeared to seize control of the Russian military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don that oversee fighting in Ukraine. Story continues below advertisement They then advanced towards Moscow largely unhindered. Russian media reported that they downed several helicopters and a military communications plane. The Defense Ministry has not commented. They were halted only by a deal to send Prigozhin to neighboring Belarus, which has supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Charges against him of mounting an armed rebellion will be dropped, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, and Prigozhin ordered his troops back to their field camps. The government also said it would not prosecute Wagner fighters who took part, while those who did not join in were offered contracts by the Defense Ministry. 2:22 Wagner insurrection causes panic across Russia, Prigozhin says will not affect Ukraine war effort Though Putin had vowed earlier to punish those behind the armed uprising, Peskov defended the reversal, saying Putin’s “highest goal” was “to avoid bloodshed and internal confrontation with unpredictable results.” Story continues below advertisement Commentators on social media over the weekend noted the irony of Prigozhin dodging prosecution for an armed rebellion while many Russians who merely speak out against the war in Ukraine have been handed lengthy prison sentences. Though the deal ended the immediate crisis, it may have set in motion a longer-term one, analysts said. “For a dictatorship built on the idea of unchallenged power, this was an extreme humiliation, and it’s hard to see the genie of doubt ever being forced back into the bottle,” said Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. “So, if Prigozhin might have lost in the short term, Putin is likely to be the long-term loser.” More on Politics Was Canada’s $20M armoured vehicle deal caught up in a UN sanctions breach? Psychedelics such as magic mushrooms are having a moment. Can science keep up? What world leaders say so far on Wagner Group chief’s rebellion in Russia Russia’s Putin calls Wagner rebellion ‘a stab in the back’ Still many questions remain. Prigozhin, who sent out a series of audio and video updates during his revolt, has gone silent since the Kremlin announced the deal. It’s not clear if he’s in Belarus yet or whether any of his Wagner troops would follow him. In response to questions from The Associated Press, Prigozhin’s press office replied that he could not reply immediately but “will answer the questions when he gets a normal connection.” Video taken by The Associated Press in Rostov-on-Don showed people cheering Wagner troops as they departed. Some ran to shake hands with Prigozhin, who was riding in an SUV. Story continues below advertisement The regional governor later said that all of the troops had left the city. Russian news agencies also reported that Lipetsk authorities confirmed Wagner forces had left that region, which sits on the road to Moscow from Rostov. Moscow had braced for the arrival of the Wagner forces by erecting checkpoints with armored vehicles and troops on the city’s southern edge. About 3,000 Chechen soldiers were pulled from fighting in Ukraine and rushed there early Saturday, state television in Chechnya reported. Russian troops armed with machine guns put up checkpoints on Moscow’s southern outskirts. Crews dug up sections of highways to slow the march. By Sunday afternoon, the troops had withdrawn from the capital, and people swarmed the streets and flocked to cafes. Traffic returned to normal and roadblocks and checkpoints were removed, but Red Square remained close to visitors. On highways leading to Moscow, crews repaired roads ripped up just hours earlier in panic. Anchors on state-controlled television stations cast the deal ending the crisis as a show of Putin’s wisdom and aired footage of Wagner troops retreating from Rostov-on-Don to the relief of local residents who feared a bloody battle for control of the city. Trending Now Orca attacks yacht near Scotland, 1st such incident in northern waters Former CFL, NFL running back Dahrran Diedrick dead at age of 44 People there who were interviewed by Channel 1 hailed Putin’s role. But the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War warned that “the Kremlin now faces a deeply unstable equilibrium.” Story continues below advertisement The “deal is a short-term fix, not a long-term solution,” wrote the institute, which has tracked the war in Ukraine from the beginning. 2:00 Wagner rebellion will ‘deplete Russian motivation’ in Ukraine war, experts say Prigozhin had demanded the ouster of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, whom Prigozhin has long criticized in withering terms for his conduct of the war in Ukraine. The U.S. had intelligence that Prigozhin had been building up his forces near the border with Russia for some time. That conflicts with Prigozhin’s claim that his rebellion was a response to an attack on his camps in Ukraine on Friday by the Russian military. In announcing the rebellion, Prigozhin accused Russian forces of targeting the Wagner camps in Ukraine with rockets, helicopter gunships and artillery. He alleged that Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff, ordered the attacks following a meeting with Shoigu in which they decided to destroy the military contractor. Story continues below advertisement The Defense Ministry denied attacking the camps. Congressional leaders were briefed on the Wagner buildup earlier last week, a person familiar with the matter said. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. The U.S. intelligence briefing was first reported by CNN. A possible motivation for Prigozhin’s rebellion was the Russian Defense Ministry’s demand, which Putin backed, that private companies sign contracts with it by July 1. Prigozhin had refused to do it. Ukrainians hoped the Russian infighting would create opportunities for their army to take back territory seized by Russian forces. “These events will have been of great comfort to the Ukrainian government and the military,” said Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Wagner troops have played a crucial role in the Ukraine war, capturing the eastern city of Bakhmut, an area where the bloodiest and longest battles have taken place. The Kremlin’s offer of amnesty to Prigozhin was negotiated by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, which might have raised his stature in his relationship with Putin. The 62-year-old Prigozhin, a former convict, has longstanding ties to Putin and won lucrative Kremlin catering contracts that earned him the nickname “Putin’s chef.” Story continues below advertisement Wagner has sent military contractors to Libya, Syria and several African countries, as well as Ukraine.",

In a very appropriate gender reveal moment, Kourtney sat on the Blink-182 drummer’s lap as he gave a drumroll before slamming the cymbals as blue confetti rained down on them and a mass of blue streamers filled the air. The happy couple, who were both dressed in white, celebrated with a kiss, giving each other a sweet hug as their friends and family cheered. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian Barker (@kourtneykardash) Kourtney publicly announced that she was pregnant last week in the audience at a Blink-182 show. The 44-year-old reality star jumped up and down holding a sign that read, “Travis I’m Pregnant,” a callback to a moment from the band’s “All the Small Things” music video. Both Kourtney and Travis have children from previous relationships. Kourt shares three children — 13-year-old Mason, 10-year-old Penelope and 8-year-old Reign — with her ex, Scott Disick . Meanwhile, Travis has two kids with his ex-wife, Shanna Moakler — 19-year-old Landon and 17-year-old Alabama. He also cares for Moakler’s daughter, Ariana De La Hoya, from her past relationship with Oscar De La Hoya. Following the baby news, a source told ET that Kourtney and Travis are on “cloud nine.” “Kourtney and Travis are on cloud nine. This pregnancy is beyond Kourtney’s wildest dreams. Kourtney and Travis feel like this is one of the most magical things to happen to them and a complete miracle,” the source shared. “They are so thrilled and can’t wait to experience this pregnancy together, bring a baby into the world as a unit, and expand and grow their families.” As for how reality TV star’s ex, Scott, is feeling about the baby news, a source told ET that “Scott is being as supportive as possible.” Travis’ ex-wife, Shanna, told ET, “I’m very excited for them. Hope they have a great experience bringing in a new life to the world.” The couple has been trying to get pregnant for years, trying out IVF and other fertility treatments. In the season 3 premiere of “The Kardashians”, Kourtney shared that they were done trying IVF and were hoping to get pregnant naturally.

            "content": "Harvey Hall ‘s days may be numbered if those fighting to save it aren’t able to raise $20,000 by the fall. Fundraising committee vice-president Jane Chrysostom told Global News they need at least that much, in addition to the $25,000 they received from a federal grant, to fix the aging building’s roof. “It’s a community icon. It’s a New Brunswick icon,” she said of the hall. The hall has been used as a community gathering place, as well as a school and other functions, since it was built in 1884. “It has a lengthy history here for the community and it’s worth saving,” she said. She said while there was lots of work to be done to the building, the most immediate, pressing need to ensure the long-term viability of the building was to fix the leaky roof. Story continues below advertisement When her group received the government grant, they had an initial one-year deadline to use the money for repairs. “Unfortunately, our time ran out when we were trying to get bids to get the jobs done,” she said, as they were unable to find a contractor available to make the repairs in time. They received an extension until this fall, but it won’t be extended again. “If we don’t use that money soon, and it’s exclusively for the roof, then we have to forfeit it,” Chrysostom said.

The hall is being used as a performance space, with the likes of comedian James Mullinger and musician David Myles performing there recently. Chrysostom said they receive funds from the admission price for performances, as well as donations from residents and former residents, but the committee is looking for larger help from other sources. “We’re looking at organizations that are in the roofing business, organizations that are in the plumbing business that have community project building in their structure. We’re really looking everywhere but it is pretty much a grassroots effort,” she said. Trending Now A N.S. valedictorian comes out during graduation speech.

Chrysostom said in addition to replacing the roof, they want a permanent solution to some of the building’s structural instability and would like to build accessible washrooms as well as make cosmetic repairs to the building. 1:47 Preserving the history of Notch Hill one building at a time Preserving the history of Notch Hill one building at a time Calgarians rally to save Ogden heritage building from demolition for Green Line LRT The Building Blocks of Antigonish Vancouver businesses close as heritage building’s façade crumbles Previous Video Next Video",
